# üéÆ Xbox Series X Review Analysis  

This project uses **web scraping, data analysis, and visualization** to explore user reviews of the **Microsoft Xbox Series X** from Best Buy.  

The goal was to collect review text and metadata (ratings, helpful votes, etc.), analyze relationships between review length and helpfulness, and uncover insights into consumer behavior.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Collection (Web Scraping)  
- Used **Selenium WebDriver** (`chromedriver`) to scrape reviews from Best Buy.  
- Extracted **2000 reviews** across ~100 pages.  
- For each review, collected:  
  - `userid`: reviewer name  
  - `review`: review text  
  - `rating`: star rating (out of 5)  
  - `helpful`: number of helpful votes üëç  
  - `unhelpful`: number of unhelpful votes üëé  
  - `net`: |helpful ‚Äì unhelpful|  
  - `net_helpful`: helpful ‚Äì unhelpful  
  - `total`: helpful + unhelpful  
  - `review_length`: length of the review (characters)  

First 4 rows:  

| userid  | review                                                                 | rating | helpful | unhelpful | net_helpful | review_length |

### 2. Data Analysis  

- **Scatterplot: Review Length vs. Total Votes**

    - Best-fit line: slightly upward sloping.  
    - Correlation coefficient: **0.15** ‚Üí weak positive relationship.  
    - Interpretation: longer reviews get *slightly* more total votes, but the effect is weak.  


- **Scatterplot: Review Length vs. Net Helpful Votes**  
<img width="691" height="303" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-17 at 4 26 50‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ec45a63-02f8-49e4-8a54-799ba7dca947" />

    - Best-fit line: almost flat.  
    - Correlation coefficient: **0.03** ‚Üí essentially no relationship.  
    - Interpretation: longer reviews are not necessarily seen as more helpful.

### 3. Key Findings  

1. **Review length is not strongly tied to helpfulness.**  
   - Longer reviews do not guarantee more helpful votes.  
   - Conciseness may be equally valued by readers.  

2. **User engagement varies widely.**  
   - Some reviews have hundreds of helpful votes, while many get none.  

3. **Surprising outcome.**  
   - The assumption that longer reviews = more helpful votes was **not supported**.
